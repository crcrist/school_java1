Exercise 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a
comment
- a statement is a part of a program that specifies that specific one step of an algorithm, for example below the "System.out.println("Hello, World!");" is a statement

2. What does it mean to say that a program is portable?
- Java programs are compiled into bytecode which is contained in a .class file. and can be read and executed by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) on any operating system that has the JVM installed. 
This is what prompted the slogan for java "write once, run anywhere".

3. In common English, what does the word compile mean?
- to produce something such as a list, by assembling information collected from other sources. 

4. What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun? 
- an executable is a name for object code that is ready to run on specific hardware, this is a shortened version of saying "executable file". After the code we have below is compiled, it becomes an executable file, and contains machine code that are the 
instructions the processor will carry out when the file is executed. An executable is self-contained, and has everything it needs to run the instructions.

Exercise 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------
public class first_file {
   public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        System.out.println("Hello, I am good, how are you?");
        System.out.print("good how are you?");
        // this is a comment!
    }    
}
